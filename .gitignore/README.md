# Rot_Cipher
A basic rotational cipher in Python

This seemed like a very basic problem that I could solve fairly easily. 
At first I was going to make a list to list translation of the plain text letters and ciphertext letters, 
but when I was discussing the problem out loud with someone, they suggested just using ASCII values instead.
Once I looked up how to do ASCII in python, the rest fell into place fairly quickkly.

I know that keeping the spaces is not good cryptography, but for testing purposes it helped me maintain clarity.
Honestly, keeping the spaces was the part of this program that took the longest.

I would like to clean up the output a little to not be in list format, but I need to review a way of moving the output to a String
